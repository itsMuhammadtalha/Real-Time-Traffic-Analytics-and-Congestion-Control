# Real-Time Traffic Analytics and Dynamic Signaling

## Abstract
Our final year project, titled "Real-Time Traffic Analytics and Dynamic Signaling," aims to address the challenges of traffic congestion in urban areas by leveraging real-time traffic data analytics and dynamic signaling systems. By utilizing advanced technologies such as machine learning and data analytics, our project seeks to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and improve overall transportation efficiency. This README file provides an overview of our project.

## Problem Statement
Traditional traffic signal systems often struggle to adapt to changing traffic conditions, leading to congestion, delays, and inefficiencies in traffic flow. Our project seeks to overcome these challenges by implementing real-time traffic analytics and dynamic signaling systems. By monitoring and analyzing traffic patterns, dynamically adjusting signal timings, and prioritizing congestion alleviation strategies, we aim to improve traffic management and enhance urban mobility.
